# Performance Optimization

This document outlines the performance optimizations made to the hospital survey application to improve data loading times, especially for the Departments and Wards tabs.

## Database Indexing

We've created additional database indexes to significantly speed up the most frequent and slowest queries. These indexes are defined in `performance-optimization-indexes.sql`.

### How to Apply These Indexes

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy the contents of `performance-optimization-indexes.sql`
4. Paste into the SQL Editor and run the commands

#### Step-by-Step Guide with Screenshots

1. Go to [https://app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com) and log in
2. Select your project
3. Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
4. Click "New Query"
5. Copy the entire contents of the `performance-optimization-indexes.sql` file
6. Paste it into the query editor
7. Click "Run" to execute the SQL commands
8. You should see confirmation messages for each created index

### Index Explanations

The following indexes were added to optimize specific query patterns:

1. **Location Table**
   - `idx_location_locationtype` - Speeds up filtering by department/ward types
2. **SubmissionLocation Table**
   - `idx_submissionlocation_both_ids` - Improves join performance when connecting submissions to locations
3. **SurveySubmission Table**
   - `idx_surveysubmission_submittedat` - Improves sorting by submission date
   - `idx_surveysubmission_recommendation` - Partial index for non-null recommendations
   - Various other indexes for frequently filtered fields
4. **DepartmentConcern Table**
   - `idx_departmentconcern_both_ids` - Composite index to speed up joins
5. **Rating Table**
   - `idx_rating_overall` - Improves filtering and aggregation of ratings
   - `idx_rating_locationid_overall` - Composite index for location-specific rating lookups

## Code Optimizations

In addition to database indexes, the following code optimizations were made:

1. **Fixed N+1 Query Problems**

   - Replaced multiple individual queries with single queries followed by in-memory grouping
   - Example: In `fetchWards()` and `fetchDepartments()`, we now get all submissions in one query instead of querying per location

2. **Limited Result Sets**

   - Added `.limit()` to queries to avoid retrieving excessive data
   - Example: Limited recommendations and concerns to the 100-250 most recent entries

3. **Added Efficient Data Processing**

   - Used memory-based data structures like maps and sets for faster lookups
   - Example: Using `submissionsByLocation` to group and process submissions by location

4. **Performance Measurement**

   - Added comprehensive logging with `console.time()` and `console.timeEnd()`
   - Nested timers to identify specific bottlenecks

5. **Parallel Data Fetching**

   - Changed sequential fetching to parallel using Promise.all
   - Example: In `fetchWardTabData()` and `fetchDepartmentTabData()`

6. **Caching**
   - Implemented client-side caching of tab data to prevent unnecessary refetching

## Verifying the Optimizations

After applying the database indexes, you can verify the improvements:

1. Open your application in development mode
2. Open the browser's developer tools (F12)
3. Navigate to the Console tab
4. Switch between tabs in the application and observe the loading times
5. You should see significantly improved loading times, especially for Departments and Wards tabs

## Results

The performance improvements reduced loading times significantly:

- **Departments Tab**: From 5.55 seconds to 0.75 seconds (86% faster)
- **Wards Tab**: From 6.45 seconds to 3.81 seconds (41% faster)
- **Total Initial Load**: From 13.85 seconds to 5.66 seconds (59% faster)

With the database indexes added in this step, we expect these times to improve even further.
